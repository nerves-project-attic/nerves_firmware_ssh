#
# Upload new firmware to a target running nerves_firmware_ssh
#
# Usage:
#   upload.sh [destination IP] [Path to .fw file]
#
# If unspecifed, the destination is nerves.local and the .fw file is naively
# guessed
#
# You may want to add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` to avoid recording
# the IP addresses of the target:
#
# Host nerves.local
#   UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
#   StrictHostKeyChecking no
#
# The firmware update protocol is:
#
# 1. Connect to the nerves_firmware_ssh service running on port 8989
# 2. Send "fwup:$FILESIZE,reboot\n" where `$FILESIZE` is the size of the file
#    being uploaded
# 3. Send the firmware file
# 4. The response from the device is a progress bar from fwup that can either
#    be ignored or shown to the user.
# 5. The ssh connection is closed with an exit code to indicate success or
#    failure
#
# Feel free to copy this script whereever is convenient. The template is at
# https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_firmware_ssh/blob/master/priv/templates/script.upload.eex
