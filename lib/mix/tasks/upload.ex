defmodule Mix.Tasks.Upload do

  @shortdoc "Uploads firmware to a Nerves device over SSH"

  @moduledoc """
  Upgrade the firmware on a Nerves device using SSH.

  By default, `mix upload` reads the firmware built by the current `MIX_ENV`
  and `MIX_TARGET` settings, and sends it to `nerves.local`. Pass in a another
  hostname to send the firmware elsewhere.

  NOTE: This implementation cannot ask for passphrases, and therefore, cannot
  connect to devices protected by username/passwords or decrypt
  password-protected private keys. One workaround is to use the `ssh-agent` to
  pass credentials.

  ## Command line options

   * `--firmware` - The path to a fw file

  ## Examples

  Upgrade a Raspberry Pi Zero at `nerves.local`:

      MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix upload nerves.local

  Upgrade `192.168.1.120` and explicitly pass the `.fw` file:

      mix upload 192.168.1.120 --firmware _build/rpi0_prod/nerves/images/app.fw
